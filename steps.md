# Steps

## Recommendations

* use an IDE preferably with syntax highlighting
* run the code every time you write a statement
* split the code in several files
* try not to jump ahead

**You should be able to execute the statements more than once without errors and
without changing the structure or the content of the database.**

* [Database schema](steps-01.md)
* [Populate database](steps-02.md)
